      <h3>Walk In Acid Rain</h3>
      <p>I made this piece in my ART 74 class when we took an image and made ajustments to the image to make it glitch art. I really like how it came out, and the colors are very bright which I really like about this artwork.</p>

      <h3>Moving Trip colors</h3>
      <p>This was made in my ART 74 class, which is just another glitch art piece I made because i really enjoyed making glitch art. However, I added a twist to this by adding colors such as yellow, blue, and pink so that when under LED lights the colors makes the piece have more movement in it.</p>

      <h3>New Species</h3>
      <p>I had to come up with a new species in my class, so I decided to mix a bunny with a butterfly. Pretty simple piece I did that was kind of quick to do, but still pretty happy with the outcome.</p>

      <h3>Rainbow Fish</h3>
      <p>I took a random image of a girl sitting on rocks and I edited some fish I hand made on the side and photoshopped them in the image, giving the image a beautiful, colorful, explosion of color. I shaped all the fishes in different sizes and just keep the same color scheme in the image to make it not so overwhelming it with color.</p>

      <h3>Under the Knife</h3>
      <p>This was for my ART 75 class, and for this I had to take an object and wrap it up. I deicded to wrap up my frined in caution tape while I edited surgery lines on her face. The message I wanted to portray for my work was the dangerous deaths that is caused by plastic surgery.</p>

      <h3>Phantom of Terror</h3>
      <p>I had to make a book cover for my class of this book called, "Phantom of Terror." This was where I was kind of first wokring with photoshop, and I enjoyed how the outcome of wokring with photoshop. It's pretty simple, but I still like the work I put behind it.</p>

      <h3>Moving on</h3>
      <p>This is a little more of the photography side, but I did some heavy editing in the photo. I added the extra lighting glow for the person in the picture because I wanted to add that beautiful streak on extra light to give it a dark with slight light setting.</p>

    <p>I made this in ART 75 which was a short little horror movie I made for spooky halloween month. It took a lot fo editing, filters, and moving around the camera, but I really enjoyed making this. I want to work in movie production after college, so doing videos espically horror ones are my favorite.</p>

    <h3>Artist Statement</h3><br>
      <p>Art to me can be in any kind of form. It can be simple art, art that takes hours, art that is on paper, or even on media. Making art and discovering art in all forms has always been an interest of mine since I was young. I like creating pieces of work that other people take an interest in, or knowledge of my work that they think it's good. When I make art it helps me come to a peace within myself because it helps me focus and distracts me from things I am going through mentally. I went from making traditional art, to media recently which I am still getting used to since it was a shift of work style for me. Other than that seeing, discovering, and learning different art I grew a liking into Digital Media Art. Learning Digital Media I was a little nervous about since I have no knowledge of adobe, photoshop, and big editing programs. I am still in the learning process of it, but so far I really enjoy DMA since I can edit and make art like covers. At first I had no idea about what I wanted to do going into this major career wise, but after careful consideration I realized that I wanted to do Digital Media designing for magazine covers like Vogue, Calvin Klein, etc. I want to be able to edit models in magazines that become popular. Since I wish to do this in the future as my career I am working on my editing, photoshop, and digital media skills. I made a few cover pieces in my Intro to Digital Media class, but I am also learning through other classes I take like photography, and I am also learning by myself as I go so I can make pieces off to the side for a better understanding of learning how to use those platforms. I am trying my best to be successful with pursuing this major and taking it further as a career. I do wish to work in the fashion and design industry, and want my work to be recognized since I know this is a competitive industry to be in for work. However, I am very determined I am going to be in this field working and pursuing my work further by taking it global even. I really want to join the DMA program to further my skills in other DMA related classes to make sure I can get the best results for making content like making covers. I want my skills to be recognizable and to be globally recognized even. It would be a long road for that, but I am willing to work hard to make sure I am successful and I can do things such as this for myself. Having this mindset is what makes me an artist and I believe that anyone can do that same with whatever mindset they wish to have about art in whatever form they wish to see it as.</p>

      <h3>Future Project Ideas</h3>
      <p>I wanna work with making more things phyiscally, but also continue to work on my editing skills, so a current project I am working on is a video with speical 3D effects in the video. I'm in the process of learning how to work with 3D and other features I haven't really explored in photoshop right now on the side. I am also looking for interships that will teach me more insight about how to work around Digital Media editing.</p>
